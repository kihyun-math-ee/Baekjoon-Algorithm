# BOJ 24262: Algorithm Execution Time 1
# Time Complexity: O(1)
# 
# Analysis of Pseudocode:
# MenOfPassion(A[], n) {
#     i = ⌊n / 2⌋;
#     return A[i];
# }
# 
# 1. The algorithm performs a single integer division and one array lookup.
# 2. It contains no loops. Therefore, regardless of input size n, the core logic executes exactly 1 time.
# 3. Because it runs in constant time O(1), the highest degree of the polynomial (n^0) is 0.
